# Soul Sworn: A Card-Based Rapid Role Playing Game

No one really knows why it happens. Some people just wake up one morning, shower and brush teeth, and discover later that day there’s a wraith in their coffee shop or a winged fairy at their grocery store. That’s if they’re lucky. More typically, fresh abductees find themselves nose-to-teeth with something ghastly just before spewing magic in self-defense. For the ones that make it through that first encounter, this story is too common to be coincidence. 

The normals never see the Obscura. Sure, they’ll see you. Talk to you. They might even witness you flinging your arms and yelling fully deranged nonsense. But when you’re gushing blood from a sudden rent in your gut, the normals forget you’re even there. And after you finally kick it, the normals step over your corpse, move their grocery store carts around whatever is left of you, have no recognition you were dismembered in the dairy section and drained of blood like squeezable yogurt.

They’ll never see you, never help you. And the predators of the Obscura flow around them like cars dodging a couch on the freeway. It’s maddening.

As for the why? Entire books have been written on this subject. That is to say, no one fucking knows. But if you ask me, it has something to do with the predators. Some of our oldest survivors call them the Soul Sworn.

That’s the part we try not to think about, honestly. Those monsters used to be us, which is maybe not so hard to believe. This place… does something to you. Breaks your spirit. And then the praying begins. To gods, to devils, to something else… When you’re tired of living in fear but you’ve seen what happens to the dead, you’ll swear fealty to anyone or anything that might reprieve your misery. You’ll even swear on your soul.

Yeah, sorry. I don’t mean to be a downer, but there’s no point to covering shit in sugar. There’s still beauty in the world, and humor and love. And yes, death was coming for all of us anyway, but if it was _only_ death, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. 

Do yourself a favor – come up with an exit strategy today, right now. And surround yourself with people that aren’t afraid to pull the trigger. Because if you think you’re different, that you’ll be the exception, that you’re the ultimate survivor, you won’t be. You’ll end up soul sworn like the rest of the hopeful, and your friends will put a bullet through your head anyway.

### **Introduction**
_Soul Sworn_ is a card-based role playing framework in which the players, not an authoritarian storyteller, develop the story and the narrative. Every card played represents a scene in the story, and it’s up to the group whether scenes are triumphs or utter disasters. Games can be slow or swift, cooperative or contentious. Gameplay is story-heavy with generalized mechanics and minimal calculations. And since each game card is merely a story prompt, it’s up to the players whether they want to follow the rules to-the-letter, go completely off the rails, or even make their own rules.
Story rules the day.

### **Setup**

**Dealer's Role:**
   1. The dealer decides how many cards will go into the draw pile based on how long of a game the group wishes to play. 
2. The dealer decides if there will be limits per round on voting.
3. Optionally, the dealer may decide to use objective cards. In this case, the dealer looks through the deck and selects the card to set the *End-Game* scenario. Advanced players may decide to play additional individual player objectives, but these will be drawn at random.
4. The dealer looks through the deck and selects a card to set the *Origin* scenario. This card is played first as the dealer sets-up the story. The rest of the deck is shuffled and placed as the draw pile.
5. Optionally, the dealer can forgo character play to serve as arbiter, make final rulings on scenario plausibility, maintain game flow through turn-timer management (if a turn-timer is being used) and supplemental world-building, and validate completion of the objective.
**Player Setup:**
   1. Each player draws a *Character Card* and will role play this urban fantasy trope. Alternatively, players may openly select their character card.
   2. Players are dealt *5 cards each* from the shuffled deck.
   3. Players receive 7 tokens place across the Rational, Emotional, and Physical attributes of their character. Each character has a required token allocation as printed on the card, but once these tokens are placed, the remaining tokens can be allocated as desired. 
4. Assign each player a number for turn order via any method desired (typically, play progresses clockwise). The dealer, if playing a character, is always player one. Play progresses from player one to player two and onward.

#### **Gameplay**

**Timers & Tokens:**
   1. Though not required, use of a turn-timer is encouraged for rapid play, so each player has equal time intervals to integrate their card into the story, expanding on the origin scenario. Anywhere from 20 seconds to 2 minutes will keep the game moving. (Note: there is no penalty for going over time, but the group should feel justified in booing the offending player for being a time hog).
   2. Tokens placed on the relevant attribute let the player add a corresponding value to their roll (e.g., 1 token on Emotional in an emotional scenario adds +1 to the D20 roll).

**Play Sequence:**
   1. **Play a Card**: On their turn, each player chooses a card to add to the narrative from their hand. Character _special skills_ may be played at any time according to the limits set on their character’s card, even if it’s not that player’s turn.
   2. **Describe the Impact**: In the allotted time, the player must propose a narrative for the scene and their character that integrates the card details. The player must suggest (at least) one _skilled action_ for their character to try upon which their narrative proceeds according to plan… or not. (A _skilled action_ is any action outside the mundane for which failure poses a significant risk). Players MAY NOT narrate other character reactions. Once a narrative has been proposed, the timer stops.
3. **Role-Play One**: If the proposed narrative would elicit other character reactions prior to the initial skilled action, this is the time to role-play such responses. 
   4. **Skilled Action **: To determine if proposed skilled actions succeed or fail, the group determines if the scenario leans on Rational, Emotional, or Physical attributes. Players will roll for success or failure.
5. **Narrative Resolution**: Depending on success or failure, the appropriate player will resolve the scene.
6. **Role-Play Two**: Each character will be able to role play their response until it’s clear the scene is over. 

  **Roll & Results**:
 - Scenario success is achieved by the roll + tokens meeting or exceeding an 11, with:
	   - **Success**: Player’s scenario integrates as described and success resolution should be described.
	   - **Critical Success (Nat 20)**: An extraordinary twist is added.
	   - **Failure**: The next player in turn-order narrates the failure’s outcome.
	   - **Critical Failure (Nat 1)**: A highly exaggerated misfire described by the next player.

**End of Round & Card Draw**:
   1. At the end of each round (when all players have contributed), each player may refresh their hand to 5 cards from the draw pile. The dealer’s next turn signals the start of a new round.

<!--\#### **Special Cards & Rules**-->

<!--**Teachable Moments**:-->
   <!--1. Each player can use *one reaction per round* (Teachable Moment or Magic card). Teachable Moments can shift attributes, adding or transferring a single token between players or personal attributes.-->
   <!--2. **Magic**: Variable and chaotic, these reaction cards add narrative twists. Magic can only be played by each player once per round. The magic may be stacked with multiple cards and their effects, but only if the magic card allows for stacking. A non-stacking card can never be combined with other cards, whether other can cards stack or not.-->

**Voting**:
   1. *Plausibility Votes* are only called if a player challenges a scenario. The dealer can choose the voting frequency: once per scenario, limited per round, or per player per game. (BRIAN: consider anonymous voting)

---

#### **Endgame**

**Resolution & Superlatives**:
   1. Game concludes when the objective is reached or the draw pile depletes, and each player wraps up the story in one last round.
   2. The group places anonymous votes for:
	1. Best Roleplay - 
	2. Best Story Arc - 
	3. Best Dressed -
	4. Best Effort - 

**PVP Endgame Goals**:
   1. At the end of the first round, players choose individual goals (e.g., “rescue an ally,” “defeat the antagonist”). *Endgame Cards* (optional) could define group objectives, such as “rescue the ally” or “reclaim the magical artifact.”

<!--\#### **Expansion Potential**-->

<!--1. Future editions—*Steampunk*, *Space Opera*, and more—can introduce decks tailored to each setting, adding new characters, items, magic, and obstacles that fit the vibe and keep the gameplay dynamic and fresh.-->
