# Optimization Attempt 1: SoulSworn Codebase

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to optimizing the SoulSworn codebase based on the dependency analysis. The plan is divided into phases, with each phase containing specific increments. Each increment will be executed only after explicit approval and analysis of the previous increment's success.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Testing Framework
- [ ] Create test suite for critical functions
- [ ] Document expected behavior for all modified functions
- [ ] Implement automated tests where possible
- [ ] Create manual testing checklist for UI interactions

### Monitoring System
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement error tracking
- [ ] Create rollback procedures
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics

### Feature Flagging
- [ ] Implement feature flag system
- [ ] Create toggle mechanisms for new implementations
- [ ] Document flag states and dependencies

## Phase 1: Preparation (Low Risk)

### Increment 1.1: Utility Function Extraction
- [x] Extract `shuffleArray()` to utility module
- [x] Extract `findCardById()` to utility module
- [x] Create utility function test suite
- [x] Update all references to use new utility functions

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created utils.js with both utility functions
- Used a traditional script approach to maintain compatibility with existing code
- Created a dedicated test page (utils-test.html) for independent function testing
- Removed the original function definitions from script.js
- Added utils.js to index.html to make functions available globally

### Increment 1.2: Global State Wrapper
- [x] Create state management wrapper
- [x] Implement getters/setters for global variables
- [x] Add state change logging
- [x] Update direct global variable access to use wrapper

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created state.js with a comprehensive state management system
- Used traditional scripts (not ES modules) for compatibility
- Implemented getters/setters with validation
- Added state change history and logging features
- Created convenience modules (Decks, Players, Game)
- Added state-bridge.js for backward compatibility
- Created a state-test.html page for testing state functionality

### Increment 1.3: Basic Logging System
- [x] Implement function call logging
- [x] Add performance timing measurements
- [x] Create log aggregation system
- [x] Set up log analysis tools

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created logger.js with comprehensive logging capabilities including different log levels
- Added performance monitoring with timing functions and thresholds for slow operations
- Implemented function call monitoring and wrapping for automated logging
- Created a test page (logger-test.html) for testing and visualizing logs
- Added a bridge file (logger-bridge.js) to seamlessly integrate logging with existing code
- Added error capturing for more robust debugging
- Integrated with the state management system from Increment 1.2

## Phase 2: UI Separation (Medium Risk)

### Increment 2.1: Notification Service
- [ ] Create notification service module
- [ ] Implement notification queue
- [ ] Add notification styling system
- [ ] Replace direct `showNotification()` calls

### Increment 2.2: Event System
- [ ] Implement basic pub/sub system
- [ ] Create event registry
- [ ] Add event logging
- [ ] Migrate UI updates to event system

### Increment 2.3: UI Component Isolation
- [ ] Extract card rendering logic
- [ ] Create UI component registry
- [ ] Implement component lifecycle management
- [ ] Add component state tracking

## Phase 3: Core Logic Refactoring (High Risk)

### Increment 3.1: Card Management Module
- [ ] Create card factory
- [ ] Implement card registry
- [ ] Add card lifecycle management
- [ ] Migrate card creation to new system

### Increment 3.2: Game Initialization
- [ ] Break down `startGame()` into smaller functions
- [ ] Create initialization pipeline
- [ ] Add initialization validation
- [ ] Implement error recovery

### Increment 3.3: Dependency Injection
- [ ] Create dependency container
- [ ] Implement service locator pattern
- [ ] Add dependency resolution
- [ ] Migrate function calls to use DI

## Phase 4: State Management (High Risk)

### Increment 4.1: State Store
- [ ] Create immutable state store
- [ ] Implement state reducers
- [ ] Add state validation
- [ ] Create state migration system

### Increment 4.2: Action System
- [ ] Create action creators
- [ ] Implement action middleware
- [ ] Add action logging
- [ ] Create action validation

### Increment 4.3: State Integration
- [ ] Migrate global state to state store
- [ ] Update UI to use state store
- [ ] Add state persistence
- [ ] Implement state rehydration

## Success Criteria

For each increment, the following criteria must be met before proceeding:

1. **Functionality**
   - All existing features work as expected
   - No regression in functionality
   - Improved performance metrics

2. **Code Quality**
   - Reduced dependency complexity
   - Improved test coverage
   - Cleaner code organization

3. **Stability**
   - No new bugs introduced
   - Error rates remain stable or decrease
   - Performance remains stable or improves

## Rollback Procedure

If any increment fails to meet success criteria:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Revert code changes
   - Restore previous implementation
   - Notify team of issues

2. **Analysis**
   - Document failure points
   - Identify root causes
   - Propose alternative approaches

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fixes for identified issues
   - Update test suite
   - Prepare for retry

## Next Steps

After completing this document:

1. Review and approve the overall plan
2. Begin with Increment 1.1
3. After each increment, request analysis of success
4. Proceed to next increment only after explicit approval

## Notes

- Each increment should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- All changes should be documented in the codebase
- Performance metrics should be collected before and after each increment
- Team should be notified of all significant changes
