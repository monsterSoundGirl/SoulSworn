# Code Optimization Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to code optimization and refactoring for the SoulSworn project. The methodology is designed to break down large, complex refactoring tasks into manageable steps that minimize risk while maximizing impact. This procedure should be followed for each objective in the codebase streamlining roadmap.

## The Multi-Pass Diagnostic Process

### 1. Initial Objective Analysis

1. **Extract Objective Details**
   - Identify the specific objective from `codebase_streamlining.md`
   - Create a dedicated markdown file named `objective{n}.md` where n is the objective number
   - Copy the objective details to establish context

2. **Define Target Outcomes**
   - Document what success looks like
   - Establish clear metrics or criteria to evaluate completion
   - Set boundaries for the scope of changes

### 2. Multi-Pass Evaluation

Execute three independent evaluation passes of the codebase related to the objective, each providing a fresh perspective:

1. **First Pass: Broad Survey**
   - Identify key structures, patterns, and components relevant to the objective
   - Document the high-level architecture and organization
   - Map initial dependencies between components
   - Establish a baseline understanding of the scope

2. **Second Pass: Detailed Analysis**
   - Perform a deeper examination of specific code sections
   - Identify all relevant functions, variables, and their relationships
   - Map detailed dependencies between components
   - Identify potential implementation challenges and edge cases

3. **Third Pass: Comprehensive Review**
   - Examine the entire codebase with a fresh perspective
   - Verify findings from previous passes
   - Identify anything missed in earlier passes
   - Refine the understanding of dependencies
   - Consider additional modules or structures if needed

4. **Documentation After Each Pass**
   - Append findings to the objective markdown file in a dedicated section
   - Maintain separation between passes to preserve independent perspectives
   - Document similarities and differences between passes

### 3. Comparative Analysis

1. **Identify Consistencies**
   - Note elements that were consistently identified across all three passes
   - These represent high-confidence aspects of the codebase

2. **Analyze Differences**
   - Examine discrepancies between the three passes
   - Determine which perspective is most accurate for each discrepancy
   - Resolve conflicts to form a unified understanding

3. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Combine insights from all three passes into a cohesive plan
   - Identify the most reliable path forward based on multiple perspectives

### 4. Implementation Planning

1. **Create Modular Steps**
   - Break down the objective into small, manageable chunks
   - Prioritize low-risk changes with high impact
   - Establish a logical sequence that respects dependencies

2. **Set Implementation Order**
   - Begin with the least dependent components
   - Gradually move to more complex, interdependent components
   - Ensure each step can be tested independently

3. **Define Test Points**
   - Establish verification steps after each implementation phase
   - Define clear success criteria for each module

## Application to Specific Objectives

When applying this methodology to a specific objective (Objective n):

1. Create `objective{n}.md` file
2. Extract details from `codebase_streamlining.md`
3. Perform the three-pass evaluation
4. Conduct comparative analysis
5. Develop an implementation plan
6. Execute the plan in small, testable increments

## Example Workflow for Objective Implementation

```
# For Objective n:

## Preparation
1. Create objective{n}.md
2. Extract objective details from codebase_streamlining.md
3. Define success criteria

## Evaluation
1. Perform First Pass evaluation
2. Document findings in objective{n}.md
3. Perform Second Pass evaluation
4. Document findings in objective{n}.md
5. Perform Third Pass evaluation
6. Document findings in objective{n}.md

## Analysis
1. Compare findings across all three passes
2. Identify consistencies and resolve differences
3. Synthesize into a unified understanding

## Planning
1. Break down implementation into modular steps
2. Prioritize by dependency and risk level
3. Create a step-by-step implementation plan

## Implementation
1. Execute each step in sequence
2. Test after each module implementation
3. Document any adjustments needed to the plan

## Validation
1. Verify the objective meets success criteria
2. Document final state of the codebase
3. Update codebase_streamlining.md to mark progress
```

## Risk Management

Throughout this process, prioritize:

1. **Low-risk changes first**: Begin with modules that have minimal dependencies
2. **Incremental implementation**: Make small, testable changes
3. **Regular validation**: Test each component after implementation
4. **Dependency awareness**: Respect the order of module dependencies
5. **Documentation**: Keep detailed notes on each change

## Conclusion

This methodology ensures a systematic, thorough approach to code optimization that minimizes risk while maximizing impact. By following this process for each objective, the codebase can be gradually improved without introducing regressions or disruptions to functionality.

When instructed to "look at the code_optimization_methodology and prepare the refinement plan for Objective n," follow the steps outlined above, starting with the creation of `objective{n}.md` and proceeding through the multi-pass evaluation, analysis, and planning phases.
