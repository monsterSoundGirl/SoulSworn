# Python Server Instructions

To start the local development server, copy and paste this message into the chat:

```
Can you please start the Python server for testing?
```

If you get an "Address already in use" error, copy and paste this message instead:

```
The server is showing an "Address already in use" error. Can you help me fix that and start a new server?
```

The server will run at http://localhost:8000 and will allow you to test all features of the application, including:
- Loading card images
- Loading JSON data
- Making AJAX requests
- Saving/loading games

You can stop the server at any time by closing the terminal window or pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.
